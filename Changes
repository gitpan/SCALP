Revision history for SCALP

0.0.1   12/01/2007
        This verison wasn't really released to anyone.
	It was only packaged as a backup before starting to play with @ISA.
0.0.2	13/01/2007
	Packaged as a module and documentation has begun.
	Even more moduler than before.
	Main core (SCALP.pm) and 3 more modules (Plain.pm, Menu.pm and News.pm) ready to be used as well thanks to @ISA.
	Does not use Exporter yet, in order to keep namespace clean and code minimal.
